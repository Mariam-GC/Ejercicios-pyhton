#Converting parsecs to lightyears. One parsec is 3.26 lightyears, so you will multiply parsecs by that value to determine lightyears.Create a variable named parsecs and set it to 11. Then add the code to perform the appropriate calculation and store the result in a variable named lightyears. Finally print the result on the screen with so it displays a message which resembles the following: 11 parsecs is 35.86 lightyears
parsecs = 11
lightyears = parsecs * 3.26
print(str(parsecs)+" parsecs" +" is "+ str(lightyears) + " lightyears")
