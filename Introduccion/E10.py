#Structured data in python
#Structured data in Python is data that allows a variable to store it as more than one value, data, or data type. Such as a set of numbers, a string of characters, letters, list, sequence, etc.
#simply create a list, declare a variable but store the elements or items in it within square brackets
objects = ["house", "car", "ball"]
numbers = [111, 112, 234] 
#show one part of the list
print(objects[1:2])
